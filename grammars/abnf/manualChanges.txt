To pass the tests in the ANTLR directory it is necessary to change rules element, and repeat

* Rules involved rulelist, rules, elements, alternatation, concatenation, repetition, element
  - Original rules in ANTLR (excerpt):
  rulelist : rule_* EOF;
  rule_ : ID '=' '/'? elements;
  elements : alternation;
  alternation : concatenation ( '/' concatenation )*;
  concatenation : repetition+;
  repetition: repeat? element;
  element: ID | ...

  - Problem: A valid rule starts with ID, and a concatetation may be a sequence of IDs,
    so an ID that names a rule may be matched as part of a concatetation.
    More formally: FIRST(repetition+) \cap FOLLOW(repetition+) = not empty (is { ID }) 

  - Solution:
  Change rule 'element' to check if an ID indicates the beginning of a new rule,
  i.e., check if ID if followed by '='
  element   <-   ID !'='


* Rule repeat
  - Original rule in ANTLR
  repeat : INT  |  ( INT? '*' INT? )
  
  - Problem: INT \in L(INT)  and  INT s1 \in L(INT? '*' INT?)
            
  - Solution: put alternative "( INT? '*' INT? )" before "INT"
  repeat <- ( INT? '*' INT? ) / INT
