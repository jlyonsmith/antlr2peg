1. grammarinator/tests_04/test_2878153605691131279435791100517606654.abnf
   - Grammarinator generated a ProseValue "<>>" , but this seems wrong according the
     definition of ProseValue in Abnf.g4:
     ProseValue: '<' ( ~ '>' )* '>';
     
   - Both ANTLR and Abnf-cfg2peg.lua rejected this input
   
   - Fix: Changed "<>>" to "<>"
