* Correctly translated the lazy repetitions in the following rules:
  STRING, COMMENT, LINE_COMMENT HTML_STRING, TAG
  
  - The conversion in rule STRING it was mandatory to pass the
    tests provided with the grammar.
    - Original rule: STRING   <-   '"' ('\\"'  /  .)*? '"'
    - Modified rule: STRING   <-  '"' (!'"' ('\\"'  /  .))* '"'
  
* Identified the non-LL(1) choice in rule statement:
  stmt <- node_stmt / edge_stmt / attr_stmt / id '=' id / subgraph
  
  - Problem: id \in L(node_stmt)  and  id s1 \in L(edge_stmt), L(id '=' id)
  - Problem (this conflict does not seem to cause a problem): SUBGRAPH \in L(edge_stmt), L(subgraph)
            
  - There are 4 conflicts, the ones marked with *auto* be solved automatically currently:
    1. node_stmt x edge_stmt (auto: put edge_stmt first)
    2. node_stmt x 'id' '=' 'id'
    3. edge_stmt x 'id' '=' 'id' (auto: put edge_stmt first)
    4. edge_stmt x subgraph
